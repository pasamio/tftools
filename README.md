Tools for Tap Forms
=====

This repository has many PHP based tools for interacting with a
CouchDB instance connected to Tap Forms for Mac and iOS.

This requires an installation of the PHP CLI and also some scripts
require the curl extension. These are available by default on macOS.

# Basic Configuration

There is a `configs` directory which contains INI files with the
configuration contained within them. By default it assumes you can
run this script with access to `/usr/local/var/tfsync` though you
can change this to suit your case.

| Option Name | Default | Description |

| dbName | N/A | This is the Tap Forms unique identifier for your database/document on the CouchDB server. |
| dbHost | `http://username:password@localhost:5984` | Hostname string for connecting to your CouchDB server. |
| features | `backup` | Features enabled for the configuration. Backup is always enabled and is the default. |
